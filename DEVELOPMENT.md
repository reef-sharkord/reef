# Development

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (optional)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bun install`.
3. Start the app:
   - With tmux: `./start.sh`
   - Without tmux: run `bun dev` in both `apps/client` and `apps/server`

Development data is stored in `apps/server/data`, including the database and uploaded files.
Delete that folder if you want a clean reset.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
bun run test
```

(if you only run `bun test` it's gonna fail, you NEED to run `bun run test`)
