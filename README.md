## What is Sharkord?

> [!NOTE]
> Sharkord is in alpha stage. Bugs, incomplete features and breaking changes are to be expected.

Sharkord is a self-hosted communication platform that brings the most important Discord-like features to your own infrastructure. Voice, video, and screen sharing without the bloat or surveillance.

## Docs

For detailed documentation, please visit our [Documentation](https://sharkord.com/docs).

## Wanna Try It Out?

Check out the Live Demo at [demo.sharkord.com](https://demo.sharkord.com).

## Getting Started

Sharkord is distributed as a standalone binary that bundles both server and client components. Get started by downloading the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/Sharkord/sharkord/releases) page. We ship binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Linux x64

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/sharkord/sharkord/releases/latest/download/sharkord-linux-x64 -o sharkord
chmod +x sharkord
./sharkord
```

#### Docker

Sharkord can also be run using Docker. Here's how to run it:

```bash
docker run \
  -p 4991:4991/tcp \
  -p 40000:40000/tcp \
  -p 40000:40000/udp \
  -v ./data:/home/bun/.config/sharkord \
  --name sharkord \
  sharkord/sharkord:latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> Upon first launch, Sharkord will create a secure token and print it to the console. This token allows ANYONE to gain owner access to your server, so make sure to store it securely and do not lose it!

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:4991](http://localhost:4991) to access the Sharkord client interface. If you're running the server on a different machine, replace `localhost` with the server's IP address or domain name.

Check out our [Documentation](https://sharkord.com/docs) for more detailed setup instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting tips.
